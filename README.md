## Inspiration
The idea for this project came from our dual passion for music and finance. We have always wondered what it would be like if fans could not only follow their favorite music artists but also invest in them like stocks. This concept—**"Where Music Meets the Market"**—sparked the vision to create a platform where users can track, invest, and see the "value" of their favorite music artists in real-time.

## What it does
Harmoney is a platform that transforms the way fans engage with music artists. It allows users to:
- **Track** the performance of their favorite music artists in real time.
- **Invest** in artists like stocks, with each artist’s value fluctuating based on data such as followers and monthly listeners.
- **Discover** trends and insights about the music industry using live data and visualizations.
- **Engage** with the artists that you love by making purchases from the money you earned in investing in them!

## How we built it
- **Frontend:** We built the user interface using React, enhanced with Tailwind CSS for a clean, responsive design. For animations and interactive UI elements, we utilized Framer Motion.
- **Backend:** The backend is powered by Node.js and Express, with MongoDB as our database to store artist data and user information.
- **Data Integration:** We integrated the Spotify API to fetch real-time data on music artists—such as followers, monthly listeners, and album information.
- **Web3 & Finance:** Using smart contract principles, we developed a unique algorithm that calculates an artist’s "stock price" based on their social metrics.
- **3D & Visuals:** For immersive visual experiences, we used react-three-fiber and Drei to render 3D components and canvases that complement the modern, data-driven interface.

## Challenges we ran into
- **Data Aggregation:** Merging real-time music data from Spotify with financial metrics and ensuring data consistency was a significant challenge.
- **Algorithm Tuning:** Creating a fair and dynamic pricing algorithm that accurately reflects an artist's value required a lot of trial and error.
- **3D Integration:** Integrating 3D components into a React application without performance issues was challenging, particularly when ensuring compatibility across devices.
- **User Experience:** Balancing a complex idea (music and finance) into a clean, user-friendly interface demanded multiple iterations of design and user testing.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- **Innovative Concept:** Successfully merging music fandom with the dynamic world of financial investments.
- **Real-Time Data Processing:** Creating a system that fetches and processes real-time data from the Spotify API to update artist values continuously.
- **Modern UI/UX:** Developing a clean and interactive user interface that makes complex data approachable for all users.
- **3D Visuals:** Integrating cutting-edge 3D visualizations that add an immersive element to the user experience.

## What we learned
- **Cross-Domain Expertise:** Combining music, finance, and technology requires understanding and balancing principles from multiple fields.
- **Data-Driven Decisions:** Leveraging real-time data can dramatically enhance user engagement and decision-making.
- **Iterative Design:** Continuous testing and iteration are crucial in developing a platform that is both functional and delightful.
- **Performance Optimization:** Integrating various technologies like 3D rendering and live data feeds taught us the importance of optimizing performance across devices.

## What's next for Harmoney
- **Enhanced Analytics:** Adding deeper analytics and predictive insights so users can make informed investment decisions.
- **Community Features:** Building a social layer where fans and investors can interact, share insights, and discuss market trends.
- **Mobile Optimization:** Expanding our platform to offer a seamless mobile experience with dedicated apps.
- **Partnerships:** Exploring collaborations with independent artists and labels to offer exclusive content and investment opportunities.
- **Global Expansion:** Scaling the platform to incorporate global music markets and real-time data from multiple streaming platforms.

**Harmoney** is just getting started. We're excited to continue pushing the boundaries of what it means to invest in music.
